# Photo Sphere Panel

Prototype to display equirectangular photos on a website using THREE.js and Angular. 

## Controls

Due to an issue related to `camera.lookAt()` and OrbitControls, I refrained from using OrbitControls and implemented custom controls based on THREE.js [example code for equirectangular images](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_panorama_equirectangular.html).
